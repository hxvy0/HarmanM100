This preset is optimized for audiophiles seeking to capture every nuance of their music. It delivers a natural and balanced sound profile, providing the closest experience to the original recording. As an audiophile myself, I've meticulously fine-tuned this preset to ensure the best possible listening experience, carefully adjusting all frequencies.

This equalizer is only for Soundcore Motion 100.
